## Welcome to the Nibble Blog 

Where curiosity meets code — **4 bits at a time.**
This isn’t just a blog—
it’s a hands-on workshop where we dive deep into building, testing programs and algorithms **together**.
No fluff, no over-the-top theory. 
Just real code, real logic, and real fun.
Got an idea or challenge? Drop it in—**your input shapes the journey.** 

Let's build the future **one nibble at a time**.
